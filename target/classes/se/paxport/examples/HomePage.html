<h1>Wicket Unit Test Examples</h1>
<p>Unit testing of the GUI is not the same as unit testing through
the GUI. Here we are interested in the logic of the GUI rather than the
placement and order of the GUI widgets on screen.</p>
<ol>
	<li><a href="#" wicket:id="checkBoxPage">The Check Box</a></li>
	<li><a href="#" wicket:id="dropDownPage">The Drop Down</a></li>
	<li><a href="#" wicket:id="radioGroupPage">The Radio Group</a></li>
</ol>
<p>Read the source and read the pages. One would believe that the
controls should be tested in a similar way, but no, they are very
different from each other.</p>
